# Prosthetic_Hand_V2
## Overview
Building on the experience from designing the first version of a 3D printable prosthetic hand (https://github.com/timohueser/Prosthetic_Hand_V1) this project aims at improving and fixing the weaknesses of the first version and implementing some new ideas. While the first version was focused on using as many low cost components as possible, version 2 uses high quality components in places where having them gives significant performance increase. This is the case most notably the case for the motors including their gearboxes and the associated motor drivers. In addition this version will not exclusively use 3D printed components. Version one has shown that some structurally critical parts need to be made from stronger material than plastic, so they will be designed to be machined from aluminium or similar metals in the new version. 3D models of all the parts in STEP and STL format as well as KiCad design files of the motor driver PCB will be available as soon as the design is finished.

## Current Progress
This project is still ongoing and currently one a prototype of the finger and its associated driving mechanism is designed so far. The finger uses a high quality maxon DC motor driving a lead screq attached on its output shaft to drive the finger. The finger itself uses has two joints that move proportionally to eachother through a rigid linkage. As shown in the render of the 3D model below the base structure of the finger is made from aluminum parts (grey in the image) with an outer shell made from plastic. This ensures high stability and reliability while still allowing the outer part to be replaced cheaply if it gets damaged and to keep the weight to a minimum. A new feature compared to the first version is the spring loaded compliance mechanism that allows the finger to flex inwards should the finger hit an obstacle. The geometry of the linkages has also been improved to give a more even force profile over the entire range of motion of the finger.
